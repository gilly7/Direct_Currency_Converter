# Direct_Currency_Converter
A very simple currency converter app that lets you convert figures from one currency to another

In this app, I carefully followed the clean architectural pattern â€” as recommended by the Android team.
# This app uses â€”
- Kotlin
- MVVM (Model View ViewModel Pattern)
- Hilt (For Dependency Injection)
- An API to get currency rate and conversion (https://currency.getgeoapi.com/) (You can use any!)
- Retrofit (For making API calls)
- Flow
- LiveData
- Coroutines (For simplifying Asynchronous operations)
- View Binding (For interacting with views)
- Some other libraries
ANDâ€¦NO â€” I didn't use Android Navigation Component â€” Its a single activity app ðŸ‘½) <br/>
This is how the final app will look like
